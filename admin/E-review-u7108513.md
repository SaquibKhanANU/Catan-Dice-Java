### Comments 

The code makes good use of objects by implementing the class Action rather than just a string called action.
The code makes use of other methods to simplify code.
The code has worked so far in a javafx implementation of doing a build action.
The code has slightly confusing variable names but has comments which explain the code.
Maybe use of else if statements could be possible here.
