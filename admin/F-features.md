List additional noteworthy features beyond those in the assignment
specification that you have added, if any.

## Player instructions

Use this section of the file to write any necessary instructions on
how to play your implementation of the game. You can assume the player
knows the game rules; the purpose of this section is to document how
to use any parts of your game GUI that are not intuitively obvious
(and not documented in the GUI itself).
To re-roll dice, click on the images that the roll dice button displayed, the images should glow indicating its clickable.
You can undo structure build as long as it is a valid remove (the structure will highlight tan if valid).
The swap button will make Knights (the jokers that are on the board) glow yellow click on the glowing knight to swap, click swap again to undo the remove yellow highlight.
If it glows/highlights its interactive.

This section is optional.
